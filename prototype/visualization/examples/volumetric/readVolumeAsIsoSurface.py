'''
Example to read volumetric data in the form of a tiff stack
or SLC (StereoLithography Contour) from files with automatic isosurfacing:

A tiff stack is a set of image slices in z. The scalar value
(intensity of white) is used to create an isosurface by fixing a threshold.
In this example the level of white is in the range 0=black -> 150=white
If threshold=None this is set to 1/3 of the scalar range.

- Setting connectivity to True discards the small isolated pieces of
surface and only keeps the largest connected surface.

- Smoothing applies a gaussian smoothing with a standard deviation
which is expressed in units of pixels.

- If the spacing of the tiff stack is uneven in xyz, this can be
fixed by setting scaling factors with scaling=[xfac,yfac,zfac]
